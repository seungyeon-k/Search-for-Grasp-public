> Finding and grasping a target object on a cluttered shelf, especially when the target is occluded by other unknown objects and initially invisible, remains a significant challenge in robotic manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for finding and grasping the target object using a standard gripper, employing pushing and pick and-place actions. To achieve this, we introduce two indicator functions: (i) an existence function, determining the potential presence of the target, and (ii) a graspability function, assessing the feasibility of grasping the identified target. The core component of our approach involves leveraging a 3D recognition model, enabling efficient estimation of the proposed indicator functions and their associated dynamics models.
